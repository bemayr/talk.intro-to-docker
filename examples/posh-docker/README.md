# PowerShell Docker Autocompletion (posh-docker)
[posh-docker](https://github.com/samneirinck/posh-docker) really makes your Docker life easier by providing autocompletion for Docker in your PowerShell.

```powershell
docker stop [TAB TAB] # is gonna save your day ;) (or at least makes working with Docker on Windows way more enjoyable)
```
